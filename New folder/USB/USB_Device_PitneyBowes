/*************************	Descriptions	************************/

	[...]
	@	we took Pitney Bowes as a reference and made a device which has same features like Pitney Bowes.
		(#) Features :
			@	Pitney Bowes shows data on Physical device's LCD as calculated by weighing device sensor.
			@	Pitney Bowes is able to communicate with Windows using USB protocol(as HID device).
			@	Pitney Bowes is able to send data on web server through USB protocol.
			
		(#)	Advancements :
			@	V-12 is able to Communicate with PC(OS: Windows) as virtual communication port.
			@	V-12 is able to communicate with PC(OS: Windows) as HID device(KeyBoard + Point of scale).
				It is able to send real time data to PC.
			@	POS is define as per standards provided in POS USB specifications.
			
	[...]
	@	VCOM Mode  :
		(#) We can get weighing device data using VCOM continuously. In this projects we implement only one way
			VOM communication.
			[ PC ] <<<----VCOM----- [ Weighing Devie ]
			
	@	HID Mode :
		(#) We can get weighing device data at specified location like a keyboard do. 
			you can get this weighing device output at your Notepad also.
			
	[...]
	@	Limitations :
		(#) At a time only one mode will operational. Either VCOM or HID Mode.
		
		
/************************	Custom Hardware	*******************************/
							[SEPL-315]
	[...]
	@	This hardware is customized version of STM32F103C8T6 Board also know as Blue Pill.
	@	Custom Board as mainly 3 important things.
		(#) USB Connection pins
		(#) 2 USART connection pins, One is standby mode.
		(#) one External GPIO Pin which uses to decide USB Modes.

	@	Revision :
		(#) None
