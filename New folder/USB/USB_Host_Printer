/===================================	Descriptions	=====================================/
[...]
@	This is a generic USB Host driver to communicate Printer on the STM32F407V-DISC Board.
	(#) we are getting data serially as INPUT which sends furthur on USB BUS as OUTPUT.
	(#) INPUT data is pre-converted into printer language. we are acting as bridge.
	(#) we are not manipulating any byte.
	(#) we have tested it on Thermal printer and Dot matrix printer as well and wroking fine.
	(#)	we have implemented 3 cammand in it.
		($) VIDPID
			(*) It returns Vendor ID and Product ID of connected Devices.
		($) BAUDRATE
			(*) It returns Baudrate of Serial communication. By default BAUDRATE : 9600 8,N,1 
		($) CHG_BAUDRATE
			(*) This command is used to change BAUDRATE of serial communication.
	
	
	
[...]
@	Limitations :
	(#) Driver is not capable to accomadate multiple devices(Printer).
	(#) Driver is specific to USB printer class.
	
	
[...]
@	Revision :
	(#) None
	
[...]
@	Update :
	(#) We can Store a Test lable into Flash. Which shows Default Conditions.
		To do this task we have to make one more command TEST.
		In This STM32F407V-DISC Board we have 128Kbytes sector-11 Which can 
		accomadate this test lable data and other data also.
		($) Open Date  : 11-06-2020
		($) Close Date : Not Implemented Yet
			(*) It is valid for other controller also only Flash page/sector size will differ.
